                    A nice raster plasma with 165 bytes
                       Coding by Project/Fobia Design
                Uses a 256-byte sintable which is calculated
                          during the program run.

        An attempt to get this plasma shown at the Assembly '95 4kb
                            introcompo was made.

                         This program is fobiaware.
                 You can rip off any piece of it you like,
                 but if you decide to use it in one of your
                own products, please consult the maker first
                  and ATLEAST give him the credits for it!

              The routine that counts the sintable is 47 bytes
            long and you can store the sinetable in any location
         you want inside your data-segment. The source IS included
       within this package and it works with ALL 8086-based machines.
    You have to do the plasma yourself or atleast try to disassemble it.
