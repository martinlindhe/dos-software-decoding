        
        Second entry is PLASMA.COM

        It contains:
                - A plasma (press <esc> to stop it)
                  This comes from a routine I was working on in pmode
                  the pmode version had a better palette. :)


        Most of this crap was written at very short notice...

        Run the .COM files included and enjoy.. if you can...
