Hello!

This is my version of the common fire-effect. It is quite size-optimized, the
COM is only 167 bytes long. But it still looks very good (IMHO)! Much better
than the other little fires in the hornet-archive. If you like to contact me,
my e-mail address is: groth@kulmbach.baynet.de

BTW: Prepare to hear more from ALPiNE soon! :-)
