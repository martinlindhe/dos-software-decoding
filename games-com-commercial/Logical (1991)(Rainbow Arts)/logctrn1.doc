Update v1.1 -

	Well it seems that I mistook that hourglass as just a time bonus
and not a time factor in the game. That hourglass timer serves as the
game time, while the time I was preventing was placing the next ball
into an open slot.

	The unlimited timer function will work correctly now and I also
put in a skip to level key. Some of those puzzles take long to finish
and I wanted to see the rest of the layouts.

Version 1.0 -
	

	This game reminded me of that safe cracking game.

	The objec of the game is to fill each of the dials with the same
color. If you've completed a dial, the dial holes will turn black.
Those dials that you haven't finished will be open or see-thru.

	In keyboard mode, you can move a ball from one dial to another
provided there is a valid path between them. To move a ball, hold
down the right shift key and then a valid direction. If the
destination dial slot already contains a ball, the moving ball will
return to the source dial.

	The trainer keys will give you unlimited men and time. I may do a
"skip to level" toggle if someone wants it. The location is a little
trickier so it'll take more than the 1/2 hour I spent figuring out
the current cheat.

	As for the trainer tune, it's been nullified by the game's INT 08
so you'll here grinding noises if you have an adlib.
