   This is a simple nerve racking game of dexterity and
   coordination.  The object is to move your piece across the
   screen and out the door on the right side without getting hit
   by a bouncing ball and without touching the walls.

   You start by choosing a level of play from 1 to 4 with 1 being
   the most difficult.  You are given three pieces to play with.
   Pressing the space bar places a piece on the board and
   positions a 'door' on the right edge which is your way out.
   The game starts with one bouncing ball and adds a ball each
   time you make it across the board.  The highest number of
   balls officially recorded to date is 23......

   You control the movement of your piece using the numeric
   keypad:
                        NW     N     NE
                           \   |   /
                            7  8  9
                        W - 4     6 - E
                            1  2  3
                           /   |   \
                        SW     S     SE
