INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Back when pinball was king, "video games" were unheard of. That is, until
Pong and Space Invaders changed all that. When Pong was first released, and
later Space Invaders, people didn't think the trend would last. Well, it
seems it did, and here we are wasting our lunch hours shooting our friends on
the office network.

Space Invaders was the first "real" arcade game. It contained all the basic
elements that make the best games today so good. Edge of your seat game play,
missiles and bombs everywhere, and a challenge to be reckoned with.

I'm sure you all know what Space Invaders is all about, but I'll deliver a
quick refresher for those of us that are too old to remember, and those of
us that are too young to know...




THE STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The story is the invaders are coming, and they're not cute and squishy like
Alf on TV. Your job is to defend Earth. Don't let the invaders land at any
cost!

The military has issued their finest canon to you, the best pilot in the
world. Everything hangs on your success...Don't let the people of Earth down!

The invaders come in fleets, swooning back and forth above the battle ground,
dropping a hell fire of bombs everywhere. The invaders descend closer and
closer to their goal. And what's worse, with every invader destroyed, they
advance faster and faster.

You must destroy untold waves of invaders to save Earth. But they're not
stupid. They refine their attack with each wave. They begin their attack
closer to the planet each time, and release more and more bombs. And if
that's not enough, they descend faster with each passing wave.

It's a good thing there are bunkers for you to hide under so you can catch
your breath! And hey...What's that? A UFO passing over the battle site?
It'll sure be sweet destroying that! That ought to wipe that stupid smile
off their...er...faces?




BACK TO THE INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Yeah, well, as I'm sure you've guessed, it's a shoot'em up. But a shoot'em
up with CLASS [grin].

I wrote this game in a week (or there abouts) in solid assembler. I wanted to
see what I could do with a game in the smallest amount of memory, and here we
are: Space Invaders with full graphics (even the original logo from the coin
op box!) in 9k. Now, that's amazin'...

I have included the source code so people can examine my techniques if they
so desire. My keyboard interrupt routines, my double buffered video for
smooth animation, my memory saving sprite routines (all the graphics are a
single bitplane), and my amazin' collision detection!

Well, okay, maybe it's not all that amazing to everyone, but some people will
no doubt find it useful (er, I hope).




THE GAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The game starts up with a title screen (check out that logo - I'm so proud of
it - I'm not an artist (really, it's true)). Waiting a few seconds will get
you another screen with a little more information on it, like game controls,
etc. The first screen gives you game scoring.

Press any key to begin play. Here are the keys you'll need to know:


                                    KEYS

                        Cursor Left  - Move canon left

                        Cursor Right - Move canon right

                        CTRL         - Fire missile (only 1 at a time allowed
                                                     - just like the arcade)

                        S            - Toggle sound on/off

                        ESC          - Exit to DOS pronto!


You may shoot the invader's bombs to avoid getting hit, but you will receive
not scoring for doing so. You're lucky to be alive!

Shoot the UFO when it comes out for a nice fat 100 point bonus.

Use the bunkers for shield, maybe even shoot a hole in one and take out the
invaders from there (coward)...[grin].

If you are hit, or the invaders land on you, you'll have to start the level
over again. Sorry, 'dem 'da breaks...

As you wipe out each wave, the invaders will begin their attack lower, speed
up quicker, and drop more bombs. Can it get any worse, you ask? It could, but
I don't practice masochism.

A free canon will be awarded every 10,000 points. I can't imagine anyone
getting more than 2...I'm not even sure it's possible!




THE SOURCE CODE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As I mentioned above, the source code is included. Use it as you will, but
give me a little credit if you are going to modify the game. By this I don't
mean put my name on it (unless you hardly changed anything - then don't take
my name off of it), I mean leave me some e-mail and tell me what you did.
I'm interested to know what people got out of my work, if anything. And it's
all I really ask - I don't want money - Just human contact (I'm so lonely!
I'm kidding...I have lots of friends. Really! (?))...

The source code may be a little rushed here and there. I was a little pressured
with another work project that needs to get done. I knew if I didn't hurry up
and finish this, it'd never get done, so I did as good a job as I could in as
short a time as possible.

I used Turbo Assembler 4.0 to assemble the source listing, and Turbo Link 7.0
to link it. I suggest you do the same. Borland language products are by far
superior to anything else available (my opinion - yours may differ, of
course)...




THE AUTHOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm a student at Kwantlen University College in Richmond, British Columbia
(Canada!), in my second year of Computer Information Systems (Diploma).

I wrote this game partially out of interest, and partially because my wife
wanted to play it. So, I dedicate this game to my wife, Deb.

If you'd like to contact me (please do if you enjoy the game, or got
something out of the source) at:

preid@Direct.CA (internet)

I can not be contacted any other way at the moment (I don't frequent any
local BBSes anymore it seems - Sigh)...So, those of you with internet access,
drop me a line and tell me what this package did (or did not) do for you...

Please note that this game and source code are FREE - I don't ask for, or
expect, any money. Just a friendly letter (e-mail)...

I am planning to write more small (older) arcade games. Have any ideas? Is
there something you'd like to play? Let me know...I'm open to ideas. I was
thinking maybe Frogger, Galaxian, Ladybug, or maybe Pacman...Hmmm...Maybe even
Defender...

Until next time, have fun...
