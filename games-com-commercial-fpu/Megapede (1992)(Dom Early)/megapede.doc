Megapede        Version 1.1             (c)  Dom. Early       1992

Intro :
-------

 The game was written to fill a gap in my PC games collection. I love the
 arcade games of old, but could find no version of this arcade classic. So
 I wrote one for the PC.

The Game :
----------

 The object of Megapede, as with any GOOD game, is to shoot as many 'baddies'
 as possible, and in doing so amount the high score. You control a base at the
 bottom of the screen which fires missiles upwards towards the ever advancing
 MEGAPEDES who 'worm' their way down the screen. Each megapede is made up of
 many segments and hitting one of these segments causes the megapede to split
 into two smaller megapedes. Touching any of these megapedes means instant
 death, as you only have one life (how realistic!).


 Other hazards include the various 'grow pills' (cleverly disguised as hearts)
 which appear around the screen. Though not fatal to touch, these pills cause
 the megapedes to rapidly grow by several segments, multiplying the enemy!
 You can destroy these pills but you must hit them with 10 missiles before
 they disappear.


 Bricks also appear around the screen and perform no useful function except
 getting in the way of your missiles and causing the megapedes to descend more
 rapidly. Again they can be destroyed but require 10 hits before disappearing.


 Finally there is the DEADLY SPIDER which scampers across the screen from time
 to time. This enemy lays lots of grow pills across the screen for the megapedes
 to gorge themselves on. He is also fatal to touch.
