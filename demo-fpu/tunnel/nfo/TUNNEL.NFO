tunnel.com.................the intro..................256 bytes
file_id.diz................product description........256 bytes

.hardware

processor       : 386+387 or better (p200 recommended)
memory          : 1k conventional
video           : standard vga (color monitor recommended)

.troubleshooting

check if  you have  at  least a  386 processor,  a  math coprocessor  and  vga
adapter. if you have all of these and the intro still doesn't work, delete  it
or write me.

.comments

yes, i know, this is very slow. a raytrace tunnel could be written much faster
with better techniques, but  there wasn't enough space  for them. if you  look
very far in the tunnel,  it looks very ugly, but  i had no space for  distance
fade-out. the texture is also simple, but this is a 256 byte intro...

.copyright license

the usual for scene products...  i won't copy that  half page text from  other
info files.  watch it,  copy  it, do  what  you want,  at  your own  risk.  no
modifications and no commercial use.
