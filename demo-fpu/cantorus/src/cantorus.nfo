Cantorus, a not-quite 256 bytes effect for Main party 2007
Rouquemoute/Titan, 3/10/2007

My First effect! Done almost entirely at the party.
There is room for optimization, but since it was for a 4k-compo,
377 bytes were good enough :)

Uses a Cellular Automaton to generate the beat pattern.

Compile with FASM
