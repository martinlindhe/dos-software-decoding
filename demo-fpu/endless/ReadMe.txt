                    "Endless Theory" - a 512b intro by Allien Senses
                                     November 2oo6

                            
                            code.......................h45h
                            music....................jammer



        This is our next tiny intro, we were hopeful it will fit into 256b
        but music player, stream and palette was too complex, so we decided to
        make it less than 512b with better graphics and higher precision. 
        The fractal we used is the Burning Ship. This prod requires
        Windows XP, and fast CPU. If you don't have fast CPU,
        just run LOW version, it's bigger than HIGH, because we added some 
        optimizations.
