plasma stripes by sort (c) 2004
===============================

this is my first compo and first dos asm project.  i decided to try it because the
ascii-opcodes-only rule looked like a fun challenge.  graphics coding is neat but 
it's not really my specialty. with this in mind, please don't make fun of my happy 
rainbow lavalamp demo or call it "gay plasma" like dawai did.  thanks and enjoy :D
