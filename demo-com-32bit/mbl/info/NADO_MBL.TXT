HISTORY
ДДДДДДД

    I watched GU-STAR, by Camorra and I really liked those little lights
moving around on a 'splitted-screen' (if you haven't seen this demo, go
get it!). I told myself that maybe I could try making something similar
in 256 bytes... Well, here it is. Enjoy!

     I made this for the 256 bytes demo competition
on Techstronics, in the month of July of 1996.

    Wondering what MBL means? Look carefully at the
ASCII up there! It's not very original, but who cares?

REQUIREMENT
ДДДДДДДДДДД

    This program requires at least a 386. I should work with any version
of DOS, since it doesn't use any of its functions. I'm not sure about it
though, because I only have IBM DOS 5.02.

HOW IT WORKS
ДДДДДДДДДДДД

    Basically, in DOS, you just have to type NADO_MBL and press your
enter key and press any key to exit. If you're not in DOS, then that's
YOUR problem. If you get tired of the same background, you can change
it by using the 'Nado' switch. Don't forget that it's case-sensitive!

Example:

Default background
C:\DEMOS\256\>NADO_MBL anything

Other background
C:\DEMOS\256\>NADO_MBL Nado

    To restore the original background, use anything as parameter.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
ДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДДД

    You probably found that out by yourself, but this is in 320x200x256
(or mode 13h). If you haven't seen a lot of demos, then, you may find
weird that there are black lines one the screen. This is because it
draws the background on even lines and the 'light' on odd ones.
