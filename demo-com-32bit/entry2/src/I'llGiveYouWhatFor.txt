For the EFNet #asm comp 10

This is my first 'demo' so i hope i do well ;)

The limitations:
 * 512 bytes
 * ONLY contain characters typable on a standard keyboard (no alt+codes, cr,
    lf). characters.txt lists the opcodes availible.

So i created a decoder to give full access to the full 386 instruction set.
Basicaly 3 bytes are packed into 4:

  xxxxxxxx
  yyyyyyyy
  zzzzzzzz

packed to

  00xxxxxx + 0x3F
  00xxyyyy + 0x3F
  00yyyyzz + 0x3F
  00zzzzzz + 0x3F

The decoder took 207 bytes leaving 305 encoded bytes == 228 bytes decoded

So that taken care of i had 228 bytes to do my demo in..

A simple plasma with a twist! The horizontal speed of one of the sines was
propertional to the sine of one of the vertical phases.. all with integers
so it tuned out a bit chunky :)

I'm looking forwards to see what some of the elite have managed to do.....
